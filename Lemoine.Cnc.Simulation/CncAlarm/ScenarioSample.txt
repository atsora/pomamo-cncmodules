# This file contains the description of alarms
#
# All alarms created and deleted by the simulator have an index. For example, we create
# a first alarm whose index is 1, then another alarm with the index 450 and then we delete
# the first alarm with the index 1.
#
# Each alarm have
# - a CncInfo
# - a CncSubInfo (can be empty)
# - a Type
# - a Number (can contain letters)
# - a Message (can be empty, '{' and '}' are forbidden)
#
# An alarm can also contain a series of properties that can be updated.
#
# Each command specifying a tool must be prefixed by "A>", followed by "Create", "Update" or "Delete"
#
# For example:
# A> Create 1 {CncInfo; CncSubInfo; Type; Number; Message} property1=value1  => Create a first alarm with the index 1
# A> Update 1 property1=value2 => property 1 of alarm 1 is updated
# A> Delete 1 => alarm 1 is deleted
# Pauses can be added with h:mm:ss
# Comments begin by "#"
# Empty lines are ignored

# Create a new alarm with the index 1
A> Create 1 {CncInfo; CncSubInfo; Type; Number; Message} property1=value1
0:00:10

# Create a second alarm with no CncSubInfo, no Message, no properties, index 450
A> Create 450 {CncInfo; ; Type; Number2; }
0:00:10

# Update the property of the alarm 1
A> Update 1 property1=value2
0:00:10

# Remove the alarm 1
A> Delete 1
